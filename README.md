### Prerequisites

    React Native:
        Install Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager):
        Download and install the latest LTS version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/w

    Install Expo CLI:

### Usage

Navigate to the `/App` directory and call `expo start` to launch the UI. The first time calling it, it will install the requisite node packages. 

Upon running `expo start` you will be prompted to choose how to render the UI. the `web` version should work out of the box, but the `ios` version may require additional installation on an ios simulator.
